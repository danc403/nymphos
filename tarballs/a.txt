Project Goals:
• Accessibility First: Building a Linux distribution with a strong focus on accessibility for users with disabilities.
• Systemd-Free: Using OpenRC as the init system, avoiding systemd.
• SELinux-Free: Not incorporating SELinux.
• Syslinux Bootloader: Using Syslinux as the bootloader.
• Minimalist and Stable: Aiming for a clean, stable, and efficient system.
• Core Functionality: Building the essential system components first.
