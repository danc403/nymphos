ok, one of the entries in this file is slider-horz-scale-has-marks-below-hover:
./assets/gtk/common-assets/assets.txt
which means we are looking for slider-horz-scale-has-marks-below-hover.png
which is found here:
./assets/gtk/common-assets/assets/slider-horz-scale-has-marks-below-hover.png

I would assume that would be the convention for all entries in each fie.
we should also be able to infer more themerc settings while parsing the lists.
we need every match that is possible for a setting in the gtk version  that will work in a themerc for openbox.
